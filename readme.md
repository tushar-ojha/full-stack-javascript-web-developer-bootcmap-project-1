## About Project: ![Technology Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technology-HTML%20%7C%20CSS-green)
  ### This project is "assignment 1" of HTML, CSS module of Full Stack Javascript Web Developer Bootcamp by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/c/HiteshChoudharydotcom) on [inueron.ai](https://ineuron.ai/) platform. 
#### Requirement/Problem statement: 
- To convert a given design (PNG file attached at the end) into HTML, CSS code.
    - Flexbox/grid/external libraries/framework shouldn't be used.
    - Responsiveness is not required.

#### Learnings/experiences from building this project:
- Took 6 hours to convert this prototype into code.
- Learnings while buiding this project:
  - Learning theory about the concepts gives us illusion that things are easy but in reality, real challenge starts at using that theory to build something! It is tough at first go!
  - Similary watching coding videos and copying code gives illusion that even development is easy but real challenge starts when we start building something of our own. Even buidling the same thing on own which one has seen in the video earlier seems tough. One stuck at multiple point.
  - CSS is not easy! Often people who learn programming languages like C++, Java, Python etc downlook people who learn HTML CSS. But in reality building complex UI in CSS is eqaully tough. As mentioned earlier learning theory, knowing properties is easy hence seems easy but using those things to build something is where game starts!


### Given design:
